## Problem statement

Riders know things no dataset does: a bike lane always blocked by delivery trucks, a pothole at a corner, a spot with frequent near misses. RideScore DC has no way for them to tell us. A hazard report would make the map more current and more trusted. But it raises real questions: what to collect, where to store it, who sees it, and how to handle false or abusive reports.

### Why it matters

The score is built from published data, which is months or years old and never mentions a blocked lane or a new pothole. Riders see those every day. Letting them report what they see would make RideScore DC more current and more trusted. Advocates could also point to patterns of reports on a corridor. Getting it wrong, though, means spam, abuse or personal data the project can't protect. So the design decisions matter as much as the code.

### Who it's for

- **Daily riders** who want to warn others about a specific spot.
- **Advocates** collecting evidence for a fix on one street.
- **The project team**, who would need to review, trust and eventually act on reports.

### How it connects

- Reports would sit alongside the **survey** in the website's database (the `app` area), built the same way.
- A report pinned to a block uses the same lasting `segment_id` as survey answers.
- **Topic 11** (admin page) is where the team would review reports.
- Projects elsewhere, such as [BikeMaps.org](https://bikemaps.org/), show what riders report when asked.

### Example ideas

- A long-press on a block opens "Report a problem" with four choices: blocked lane, surface, near miss, other.
- Reports expire after a set time unless confirmed ("still there?").
- Show reports as small icons on the map, aggregated per block rather than as individual pins.
- No names or accounts at first; rate-limit by device to curb abuse.

## 1. Tools and set up (before Saturday)

| Tool | Why | Get it |
|---|---|---|
| Git, Node.js 20+, a code editor, a GitHub account | Front-End basics | see the [Front-End Developer Guide](/tracks/website-ui/frontend-guide#step-1-—-install-the-required-tools) |
| Docker Desktop | Runs your own database, API and tile server | [docs.docker.com/get-docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) |
| uv | Runs the data-loading and migration scripts | [docs.astral.sh/uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) |

<span class="alert">Do this ahead of time.</span> Follow the [Front-End Developer Guide](/tracks/website-ui/frontend-guide), then the [Full Stack Developer Guide](/tracks/website-ui/full-stack-guide). It downloads several Docker images, so do it at home rather than on event Wi-Fi. Windows users start with [Windows WSL](/tracks/website-ui/windows-wsl). You're ready when `http://localhost:8000/health` returns `{"status":"ok"}` and the map loads at `http://localhost:8000`.

A team member who only designs the reporting flow needs no install: sketches or an AI mock-up are a fine part of a plan.

### If something goes wrong

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `/health` returns 502 on the very first `npm run stack` | The API gave up before the new database was ready. Run `npm run restart -- fastapi`. |
| `npm run stack` says port 5432 is in use | Set `DB_PORT` in `.env` (see the Full Stack guide). |
| The map has no streets after `npm run setup` | Run `npm run restart -- martin`. |

## 2. Know before you start

- **Test on your own stack.** Build and test against your local Docker copy, with made-up reports.
- **How the API stores things today.** `api/main.py` has one write endpoint (a web address the page sends data to), `POST /api/submissions`. It saves a survey into tables in the `app` schema (a named group of tables in the database). A new kind of record needs a new endpoint, a Pydantic model (a Python class that checks incoming data has the right fields), and a new table. See [Add or change an API endpoint](/tracks/website-ui/making-changes#add-or-change-an-api-endpoint). Other terms are in the [glossary](/tracks/website-ui#glossary).
- **New tables need a migration** (a numbered file that changes the database tables). Add one to `api/migrations/` and run `npm run migrate`. Add a new migration rather than editing an old one, because databases that already ran the old one won't pick up the change. See [Add a database table or column](/tracks/website-ui/making-changes#write-a-migration).
- **Tie reports to `segment_id`.** Like survey answers, a report belongs to a block's lasting `segment_id`, because the `tile_id` changes every time the map data is rebuilt.
- **Showing reports on the map is the hard part.** Martin (the server that turns the database into map tiles) publishes only what's in the `serving` schema. So displaying reports means a new view there, or loading them through the API.

## 3. The challenge

### Core goal (2–3 hours)

Choose one:

- **Proof of concept.** A rider picks a block, chooses a hazard type, optionally adds a note, and submits. The report is saved in a new `app` table on your local stack. Showing reports on the map is a stretch goal.
- **Plan.** A one- to two-page plan covering the hazard types to collect, the screens, the API and table design, how reports reach the map, and how to moderate them.

### Approaches

- Start with three or four hazard types (blocked lane, pothole or surface, near miss, other) rather than free text.
- Decide early whether reports expire: a blocked lane is temporary, a missing curb cut isn't.
- Privacy: collect names or precise times only if you need them, because data you don't keep can't leak.

### Stretch goals

- Show reports on the map as icons on their blocks.
- Define the reporting questions in a data file (JSON) and render the form from it, so questions can change without editing code.
- Let other riders confirm a report ("still there?").

## 4. Done when

::: tip Guideposts, not requirements
Use this list to tell when you have something worth showing, not as a test to pass. Change the scope, combine topics, or stop at whatever you finish: half-built with good notes is a great result, because this is a collaborative event, not a competition.
:::

**Proof of concept:**

- [ ] A report submitted from the page is saved in your local database with its `segment_id`.
- [ ] The existing survey still submits. If you have time, run `pytest` too, to check the API tests still pass.

**Plan:**

- [ ] It defines the report fields, the storage, how reports reach the map, and a moderation and privacy approach.
- [ ] It names the open decisions the team would need to make before building.

## 5. Hand in

Share whatever you got to:

- **Code:** a pull request against `develop` (a draft is fine).
- **Anything else:** a shared Google Drive folder, or a link to a document.
- **The [submission form](/tracks/website-ui/submitting-your-work)**, one per team.
- **Two slides** in the demo deck for the 4:15 demos (required).
- **Optional:** a short video link, on the form.

A plan is just as welcome as a proof of concept here.

Nothing here is mandatory on the day. If you run short on time, share what you have and tell a mentor, because unfinished work with good notes still helps the next volunteer.

Intended more for use with an AI assistant, for rapid comprehension of the issue: give it the Markdown files (Word versions are included too).
